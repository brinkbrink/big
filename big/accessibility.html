        <h2 class="subheader">The Necessity of Accessibility</h2>
        <p>With our society becoming more reliant on the web, website accessibility has grown into a necessity that benefits all. Website accessibility is especially paramount during the current COVID-19 pandemic which has brought more people than ever to the web for a range of needs; from online schooling to online shopping to socializing with loved ones. Website accessibility can be defined as a concept wherein websites are designed, developed and modified so that everybody, regardless of ability, can access and interact with them. Unfortunately, there are reportedly “millions of websites which do not follow accessibility guidelines (Crespo).” Presently, the responsibility of accessible web design is mostly in the hands of web developers. Although some avoid it out of the idea that these guidelines require more effort or knowledge than they can muster, the benefits of accessible web design far outweigh the perceived inconveniences of creating it.</p>
        <p>The statistics around this issue are disheartening. As of 2019 studies analyzing websites for accessible web design found that 70 percent of websites surveyed contained “accessibility blocks” and only one percent of the top million homepages on the web meet accessibility standards, wrote Arielle Pardes for WIRED.  This is all despite the fact that around 7 million people have a visual disability in the United States, and more than that have a myriad of other disabilities that affect their access to the web. A lot of the issues encountered aren’t even difficult to remedy--like screen readers being faced with vague labels for elements like “image1.png” or “link (Pardes).” While some web design accessibility is more nuanced, involves more knowledge, or can be more complex, simple accessibility problems like these somehow persist. Instead, many people with disabilities, and people outside of that group as well, are shut out of much of the web.</p> 
        <p>For an example of how inaccessible some websites can be with a screen-reader:</p>
        <div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpP_Km5L46E' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
        <p>The video would almost be humorous if it didn’t have such harmful consequences.</p>
        <p>The problems faced by those not having equitable access to the web are manifold; difficulty navigating websites, not knowing where links will take them, unlabeled buttons making it impossible to shop online, and even security threats. If somebody who is blind cannot access their online banking, for instance, they may have to ask another person for help, making their account information vulnerable (Pardes).</p>
        <p>The benefits of accessibility in web design does not end with people who have disabilities like being blind, being deaf, or having limited mobility. Accessible web design also benefits older populations, people using mobile devices with smaller screens, and those using the Internet in noisy environments (“Website”). Accessibility helping others unexpectedly has been a phenomenon since the curb cuts the ADA fought for; curbs were cut for wheelchair users but also ended up helping people with other wheeled objects like baby carriages or grocery carts (Pardes).</p>
        <p>Accessibility is also good for those who code or are responsible for the website. Disability laws are concerned with more than wheelchair ramps and braille on public signage--liability also includes the web. According to one article on the topic, “the number of website accessibility lawsuits in federal court [in the United States] nearly tripled from 2017 to 2018 (“Website”).” These lawsuits have been aimed at companies like AOL in 1999 and Domino’s in 2019 and helped afford some legal protection to those with disabilities. For website developers and owners these lawsuits are easily avoided with the inclusion of accessible web design.</p>
        <p>Beyond protecting themselves from legal liability, accessibility in web design can provide other benefits for those programming or owning websites. As Trenton Moss, director of Webcredible, describes it, "Accessible HTML code goes hand-in-hand with search engine optimisation." For example, if you keep readable text apart from your presentation code, making it more accessible for blind users, your site will also be better optimized for search engines. Other benefits of accessible web design for the site creator or owner include a website that will remain readable throughout changing internet standards, updating your layout will be simpler, and there will be less confusion for visitors no matter what their abilities are (“Web”). Regardless of a user’s abilities, accessible web design will most likely benefit them. Some claim that accessible websites even load faster!</p>
        <p>So the next consideration is: how does somebody design an accessible website? Ashleigh Lodge of CODE magazine attempts to answer this question, with one caveat, “There’s no “one neat trick” for accessibility; there’s no such thing as a 100% accessible website or application; and it's always something you'll be working on, just like security and performance.” She further elaborated on why this issue is complex and evolving, “Two people with the same disability can have different accessibility needs, and accessibility fixes or accommodations for one user can make things worse for a different user (Lodge).” Older populations, for example, have impairments that may be at a lesser degree but are also frequently had in combinations, like having impairments of sight, motor control and memory (Milne). </p>
        <p>There really is no “one neat trick” or one right answer when solving the issues of accessibility in web design. Lodge, however, points out some places and ways to push developers in the right direction: The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) which is a part of the W3C, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), utilizing the four major principles of digital accessibility found in POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust), and using Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) techniques (although Lodge does point out that ARIA should be used cautiously because many people who are disabled understand how sites and elements break for them and using ARIA incorrectly can cause more confusion). 
        <p>Another idea is to include more people with disabilities in the web design process. “Website accessibility evangelist,” she calls herself, Lucy Greco co founded the Blind Accessibility Testers Society (BATS) in 2016. BATS works as an online community that trades information about accessibility tools, points out problems, and makes suggestions about platform improvements.</p>
        <p>While some web developers may be overwhelmed with adhering to guidelines and considering accessibility issues, it is a benefit to themselves as well as web users everywhere to implement accessible web design. </p>
